        Few cars are as truly legendary as the Porsche 911. Instantly recognized the world over, it is a car that has
        stood the test of time, whilst remaining highly desirable and as capable as almost anything on the road. <br>
        Designed by Ferdinand ‘Butzi’ Porsche, the original 911 produced 130bhp from its flat-six ‘boxer’ engine. The C
        series 911 was introduced with a number of improvements, namely its longer wheelbase, which was supposed to
        counteract the car’s unstable handling. Its 2.2-litre flat-six also produced more power, at 180bhp. A racing car
        for the road, the RS 2.7 was a lightweight, stripped-out, 210bhp beast. Today, they are a collector’s dream
        and are considered by many to be the greatest 911 ever.

        Porsche completely revised the 911 for 1989. It’s styling was a natural development from earlier models, yet its
        chassis, engine and drivetrain were brand new. It now pumped out 246bhp and reached 0-60mph in 5.7 seconds.The
        final air-cooled 911, the ‘993’ was dramatically more powerful and featured a re-designed front and rear end,
        boosting aerodynamic efficiency. A Turbo (pictured) incarnation was introduced in 1995, featuring 4-wheel drive
        and over 400bhp.It’s fair to say the ‘996’ didn’t go down particularly well upon release; its strange ‘teardrop’
        headlights and soft
        styling didn’t help. Its new water-cooled engine proved extremely reliable though, and its many variants
        including the
        GT3, GT2 and Turbo were still about as quick as anything on the road.
